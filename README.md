## Datasets

Source: https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk <br>

However, based on the data provided, it is **not sufficient to determine whether a gender pay gap still exists.** <br>

## Limitations 
Additionally, the limitations of the data and factors that may contribute to the inaccuracies in the analysis make it difficult to conduct a more informative assessment, such as: <br>

Number 1: The dataset includes part-time employees in its employee count <br>
![GenderPayGap_Limit_One](/images/GPG_Limit_1.png) <br>

According to the criteria for a company to be included in the UK study assessing whether a gender pay gap still exists, one of the sub-criteria is the inclusion of part-time employees. Taking this factor into account may introduce inaccuracies in the data analysis, as part-time employees typically earn less than the average pay. <br> 

Number 2: The dataset includes employees who are working abroad <br>

According to the criteria, the dataset includes employees who worked overseas. Taking this factor into account may lead to inaccuracies in the data analysis, as employees working abroad often receive various benefits such as transportation and accommodation allowances. These factors can create significant pay differences compared to those in similar positions within the United Kingdom. <br> 

Number 3: The dataset include companies who did not comply to the submission deadline <br>

According to the criteria, the dataset includes companies that submitted the required data late. <br>

Number 4: The dataset has unfairly assumed several important factors across the entire company <br>

According to the recommended calculation, determining the percentage of men and women in each hourly pay quarter unfairly sorts employees from highest to lowest hourly pay. This issue is also reflected in other recommended calculations. <br>

Number 5: The dataset does not take into account the type of industry <br>

<br>

## Conclusion
Therefore, based on these five limitations, the findings reported above cannot be used as representative values to determine whether a gender pay gap still exists or whether there is any unlawful gender pay discrimination in the United Kingdom. A more thorough analysis with additional detailed information should be considered carefully.

Data Collection improvements should be considered, such as: <br>
